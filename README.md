# C/C++/DSA_Algorithms
DESIGN AND ANALYSIS OF ALGORITHMS, DATA STRUCTURE AND ALGORITHMS,PROGRAMMING IN C,C++
# Algorithms Collection in C, C++, and DSA

Welcome to my personal collection of algorithm implementations! This repository contains a wide range of algorithms and data structures implemented in **C**, **C++**, and **DSA** topics. It's organized to help with both learning and interview prep.

##Folder Structure

Each folder is categorized by topic or language, such as:

- `C++/` — OOP and STL-based implementations
- `DSA/` — Data Structures and Algorithms (e.g., sorting, searching, trees, graphs, etc.)
- `Problems/` — Solutions to popular coding problems
